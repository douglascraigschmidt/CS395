<h3>Image Crawler Reactive Streams Client App (Assignment 4)</h3>

<p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
Java functional programming features and their integration with Java
reactive streams.  In particular, in this assignment you'll develop an
app that uses the Project Reactor implementation of reactive streams
to obtain, transform, and store images.</p>

<p> Like the earlier assignments, the code you'll write here will have
GUI and will run as an Android client app that can perform all image
processing locally (i.e., entirely on the client device) or remotely
(i.e., using reactive microservices deployed on one or more
machines). Please use this GUI along with the unit tests discussed
below to help test and debug your solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul>

<li>A detailed overview of Java reactive streams (and a comparison
with Java streams) is available <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG2SEcl1aMM">here</A>.  </li>
<p>

<li>A tutorial overview of Project Reactor appears <A
HREF="https://www.baeldung.com/reactor-core">here</A>.  

</li> </ul>

Naturally, we'll cover all this material in class. <P>

<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The ImageCrawler app is packaged as a project using the latest
version of <A HREF="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android
Studio</A>.  This app is written in both Kotlin and Java and
demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.  For the purposes of
this assignment, however, you only need to be aware of the following
directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/">image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a set of unit tests
that exercise the features under test and can be used to evaluate
whether you've correctly satisfied this assignment's
requirements. </li>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="app/src/androidTest/java/assignmentTests/assignment2aTests">app/src/androidTest/java/assignmentTests/assignment2aTests</A>,
which is an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically. </li>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. The
application's minimum API is 29, so you will need to select an
emulator that uses an API >= 29. If you do not already have one
created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager" button in
the Android Studio IDE.</P>

<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" tags)!!!
In particular, you'll need to finish implementing the following "TODO"
tasks for this assignment in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/">image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers</A>
folder: </P>

<UL>

<LI> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/ReactorCrawler.java">ReactorCrawler.java</A>. You'll
need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to obtain,
transform, and store images.  This class uses Project Reactor
<CODE>Flux</CODE> and <CODE>Mono</CODE> classes to perform an "image
crawl" asynchronously, starting from a root Uri.  Depending on the
parameters used to run the tests, images from HTML page reachable from
the root Uri are either downloaded from a remote web server or read
from the local file system and the results are stored in
files. Likewise, these parameters also determine whether all image
processing is performed locally (i.e., entirely on the client device)
or remotely (i.e., using reactive microservices deployed on one or
more machines). </P>

<LI> <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/Student.kt">Student.kt</A>.
You need to complete the "TODO" task to set the <CODE>type</CODE>
field to either <CODE>Graduate</CODE> or <CODE>Undergraduate</CODE>,
depending on which version of the assignment that you're
implementing.</LI> <P>

</UL>

<p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.  In
fact, a complete solution using Java 7 features provided in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialLoopsCrawler.java">SequentialLoopsCrawler.java</A>
file.  Your will therefore focus on converting this Java 7-based class
to the <CODE>ReactorCrawler</CODE> class that uses the Project Reactor
framework.  Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops or
(unnecessary) conditional statements in this assignment and instead
use Project Reactor <CODE>Flux</CODE> and <CODE>Mono</CODE> class
operators. Your solution will be considered correct if it passes all
the unit and instrumentation tests. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS395/tree/master/assignments/assignment4/">here</a>
in my GitHub account in the <CODE>client-skeleton</CODE> folder.  You
can pull this skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and
complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> Unit tests in the <A
HREF="image-crawler/src/test">image-crawler/src/test</A> folder are
provided to increase our/your confidence that your implementation is
working as expected.  You'll need to learn how to use the Android
Studio GUI to run the unit test locally on your computer, as described
<A
HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>.
As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to detect problems in
your code. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> This assignment is more complicated than the previous assignments
since it requires deeper knowledge of Project Reactor and remote
communication via Spring WebFlux.  In particular, the asynchronous
nature of reactive streams may take some time to get accustomed to, so
please start the assignment soon and ask questions in class, office
hours, and on the discussion forums.  As usual, the app, image crawler
skeletons, and unit tests are extensive, though you don't need to
understand them all to complete your solution. </p>
