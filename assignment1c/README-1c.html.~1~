<h3>Movies Microservice (Assignment 1c)</h3>

<p>The purpose of the third (and final) part of this three-part
assignment is to deepen your understanding of how to develop
synchronous microservices with <A
HREF="https://www.baeldung.com/spring-mvc-tutorial">Spring WebMVC</A>,
Java <A HREF="https://openjdk.org/jeps/437">structured
concurrency</A>, and Java <A
HREF="https://www.baeldung.com/regular-expressions-java">regular
expressions</A>.  In this assignment you'll continue to evolve the
synchronous microservice that used Spring WebMVC from <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignment1b/">assignment
1b</A> to more comprehensively use the <A
HREF="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/jdk.incubator.concurrent/jdk/incubator/concurrent/StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure.html">ShutdownOnFailure</A>
and <A
HREF="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/jdk.incubator.concurrent/jdk/incubator/concurrent/StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnSuccess.html">ShutdownOnSuccess</A>
classes to concurrently return Lists of objects containing information
about movies from a movie recommender system we'll use throughout this
course.</p>

<p> The code you'll write for this assignment does not have a GUI and
runs as an Spring application with an automated test program. Please
feel free to use this test program to help debug your solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<HR width=50% align=left> <H4>Assignment Structure and
Functionality</H4>

<P>The Movies microservice is packaged as a project using <A
HREF="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</A>.  This app is
written in Java and demonstrates various Spring WebMVC and Java
structured concurrency features.  For the purposes of Assignment 1c,
however, you only need to be aware of the following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="movies/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/movies">recommender/movies</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="movies/src/test/java/edu/vandy/recommender/movies">movies/src/test</A>,
which is a set of unit tests that exercise the features you're
implementing to evaluate whether you've correctly satisfied this
assignment's requirements.  </LI>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided IntelliJ project.
You can run this project by clicking the green arrow next to the
"MoviesTest" dropdown menu in the IntelliJ IDE.</P>

<hr width=50% align=left> <A name="description"> <H4>Program
Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" markers
or your submission will not be reviewed)!!!  In particular, you'll
need to finish implementing the "TODO" tasks for this assignment in
the following files and folders:

<UL>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="movies/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/movies/MoviesController.java">MoviesController.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various fields/methods to
define endpoint handler methods that return Lists of objects
containing information about movies. </LI>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="movies/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/movies/MoviesService.java">MoviesService.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various fields/methods
called by the <code>MoviesController</code> that use the Java
structured concurrency <A
HREF="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/jdk.incubator.concurrent/jdk/incubator/concurrent/StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure.html">ShutdownOnFailure</A>
and <A
HREF="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/jdk.incubator.concurrent/jdk/incubator/concurrent/StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnSuccess.html">ShutdownOnSuccess</A>
classes and Java sequential streams to return Lists of objects
containing information about movies.  You'll also use Java regular
expressions to get more precise control over searches.

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="movies/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/movies/ServerBeans.java">ServerBeans.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in factory methods (known as
"Beans") that can be injected into Java classes using the Spring
Autowired annotation to load a dataset containing movie titles and
descriptive vectors. </LI>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="movies/src/test/java/edu/vandy/recommender/movies/MoviesSyncProxy.java">MoviesSyncProxy.java</A>.
You'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks to implement proxies to
various endpoints in the Movies microservice. You'll also use Java
regular expressions to get more precise control over searches. </LI>

</UL>

<p> Again, your solution should strive to use <EM>no</EM> loops or
if/else statements in this assignment and instead use Java functional
programming features (including lambda expressions, method references,
and sequential stream aggregate operations) and Java structured
concurrency mechanisms. Your solution will be considered correct if it
passes all the unit tests, is commented thoroughly, and addresses my
review comments. Solutions that are not commented thoroughly will not
be reviewed.</p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignment1c/">here</a>
in my GitHub repository.  Please setup your <a
href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account, pull this
skeleton code into your repository, read it carefully, and complete
the "TODO" markers.

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> The unit tests in the <A
HREF="movies/src/test/java/edu/vandy/recommender/movies">movies/src/test</A>
folder are provided to increase our collective confidence that your
implementation is working as expected.  As usual, testing only
demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their absence, so don't rely
solely on the unit tests to detect problems in your code. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> Assignment 1c is designed to deepen your understanding of
developing synchronous microservices using Spring WebMVC and Java
structured concurrency.  The skeletons and unit tests are subtle,
though you don't need to understand them all to complete your
solution.  This assignment is more complicated than assignment 1b, so
please start early and ask questions in class, office hours, and on
the discussion forums to ensure you complete this assignment
successfully!  </p>
