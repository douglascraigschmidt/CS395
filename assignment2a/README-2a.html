<h3>Movies Microservice (Assignment 2a)</h3>

<p>The purpose of the first part of this assignment is to deepen your
understanding of how to develop multiple synchronous microservices
with <A HREF="https://www.baeldung.com/spring-mvc-tutorial">Spring
WebMVC</A>, the <A
HREF="https://www.baeldung.com/spring-cloud-netflix-eureka">Eureka
Discovery Service</A>, the <A
HREF="https://www.baeldung.com/spring-cloud-gateway">Spring Cloud
Gateway</A>, the <A HREF="https://www.baeldung.com/retrofit">Retrofit
type-safe client API</a>, and the <A
HREF="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/persistence-jsp.html">Java
Persistence API</A> (JPA).  In this assignment you'll apply JPA to
create a database that stores information about movies and supports
various SQL queries, as well as apply Retrofit to create several
type-safe client APIs that access database and timer microservices via
an API gateway. </p>

<p> The code you'll write for this assignment does not have a GUI and
runs as an Spring application with an integration test program. Please
feel free to use this test program to help debug your solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul>

<li> A tutorial on the Java Persistence API appears <A
HREF="https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaPersistenceAPI/article.html">here</A>.

<li> A tutorial on Retrofit appears <A
HREF="https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Retrofit/article.html">here</A>.

<li> I also recommend you use <A
HREF="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</A> to help learn and code
these various APIs.
</ul>

<p>Naturally, we'll cover this material in class, which will be
available in my YouTube <A

<HR width=50% align=left> <H4>Assignment Structure and
Functionality</H4>

<P>The Movies microservice is packaged as a project using <A
HREF="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</A>.  This app is
written in Java and demonstrates various Spring WebMVC and Java
concurrency and persistence features.  For the purposes of Assignment 2a, however, you
need to be aware of the following folders:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="client/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/">client</A>, which
contains a client test driver program containing proxy skeleton(s)
you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="database/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/database">database</A>,
which contains the database microservice skeleton(s) you'll need to
fill in, as also described <A HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

</UL>

You'll also need to tweak the synchronous movies-ex microservice
implementation from <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS395/tree/master/assignment1c/">assignment
1c</A>, which is found in these folders:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="movies-ex/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/moviesex">movies-ex</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<LI style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="movies-ex/src/test/java/edu/vandy/recommender/moviesex">movies-ex/src/test</A>,
which is a set of unit tests that exercise the features you're
implementing to evaluate whether you've correctly satisfied this
earlier assignment's requirements.  </LI>

</UL>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided IntelliJ project.
You can test the movies-ex portion of this project by clicking the
green arrow next to the "Movies-ExTest" dropdown menu in the IntelliJ
IDE.  However, you'll need to a bit more to test the database portion,
which will involve first clicking on the green arrow next to the
"RunMicroservice" dropdown menu followed by clicking on the green
arrow next to the "DatabaseClientDriver" dropdown menu. </P>

<hr width=50% align=left> <A name="description"> <H4>Program
Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" markers
or your submission will not be reviewed)!!!  In particular, you'll
need to finish implementing the "TODO" tasks for this assignment in
the following files and folders:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="client/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/">client</A>, where
you'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various fields/methods to
implement a type-safe client using Retrofit. </LI>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="database/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/database">database</A>,
where you'll need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various
fields/methods of the <code>DatabaseService</code> that use the Java
Persistence API together with Java sequential and parallel streams to
return Lists of objects containing information about movies.

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> You'll also need to complete the "TODO"
tasks in factory methods in several <A
HREF="database/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/database/common/ServerBeans.java">ServerBeans.java</A>
and <A
HREF="client/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/common/ClientBeans">ClientBeans.java</A>
files that can be injected into Java classes using the Spring
Autowired annotation. </LI> </UL>

<p> As usual, your solution should strive to use few (if any) loops or
if/else statements in this assignment and instead use Java functional
programming features (including lambda expressions, method references,
and sequential/parallel stream aggregate operations). Your solution
will be considered correct if it passes all the unit tests, is
commented thoroughly, and addresses my review comments. Solutions that
are not commented thoroughly will not be reviewed.</p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS395/tree/master/assignment2a/">here</a>
in my GitHub repository.  Please pull this skeleton code into your
GitLab repository, read it carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers.

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Blackbox Integration Tests</h4>

<p> There are blackbox integration tests <A
HREF="client/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender">here</A> that
increase our collective confidence that your implementation is working
as expected.  As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of
bugs, not their absence, so don't rely solely on the unit tests to
detect problems in your code. </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> Assignment 2a is designed to deepen your understanding of
developing multiple synchronous microservices using Spring WebMVC, the
Eureka Discovery Service, the Spring Cloud Gateway, the Retrofit
type-safe client API, and the Java Persistence API.  The skeletons and
tests are quite extensive, though you don't need to understand them
all to complete your solution.  This assignment is more complicated
than assignment 1c, so please start early and ask questions in class,
office hours, and on the discussion forums to ensure you complete this
assignment successfully!  </p>
