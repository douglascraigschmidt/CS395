<h3>ParallelFlux Recommender Microservice (Assignment 3)</h3>

<p>The purpose of the third assignment is to deepen your understanding
of how to develop asynchronous microservices with <A
HREF="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html">Spring
WebFlux</A> and the <A HREF="https://projectreactor.io/">Project
Reactor</a> parallel reactive programming features.  In particular,
you'll apply the <A
HREF="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/ParallelFlux.html">ParallelFlux</a>
reactive type to implement a microservice that provides movie
recommendations to clients in parallel by leveraging multiple
processor cores. </p>

<p> The code you'll write for this assignment does not have a GUI and
runs as an Spring application with an integration main program and
many unit tests. Please feel free to use this main program and the
unit tests to help debug your solution. </p>

<p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
assignment: </p>

<ul>

<li> Overviews of <A

<p>Naturally, we'll cover this material in class, which will be

<HR width=50% align=left> <H4>Assignment Structure and
Functionality</H4>

<P>The ParallelFlux microservice is packaged as a project using <A
HREF="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</A>.  This app is
written in Java and demonstrates various Spring WebFlux and Project
Reactor features.  For the purposes of Assignment 3, however, just
focus on the following directories:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="client/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/">client</A>, which
contains a client main driver program containing proxy skeleton(s)
you need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="recommenders/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/">recommenders</A>,
which contains the <CODE>ParallelFlux</CODE> microservice server
skeleton(s) you need to fill in, as also described <A
HREF="#description">below</A>. </li>

</UL>

In addition, you need to copy and slightly extend your <A
HREF="database">database</A> microservice implementation from <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS395/tree/master/assignment2c/">assignment
2c</A>.

Please be careful not to overwrite the tests provided with these
microservice implementations since they have been updated for
assignment 3. <P>

<hr width=50% align=left> <A name="description"> <H4>Program
Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java code
by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a working
solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON - just
fill in the "TODO" tasks (and do NOT delete the "TODO" markers or your
submission will not be reviewed)!!!  In particular, you need to finish
implementing the "TODO" tasks for this assignment in the following
files and folders:

<UL>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="recommenders/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/">recommenders</A>,
where you need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various fields/methods
of the <A
HREF="recommenders/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/server/ParallelFluxServer.java">ParallelFluxService.java</A>
and <A
HREF="recommenders/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/common/MoviesLoader.java">MoviesLoader.java</A>
files to implement the reactive movie recommender microservice. </LI>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="client/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/">client</A>, where
you need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various fields/methods to
update and implement declarative client proxies using HTTP
interface. </LI>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> <A
HREF="database/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/database">database</A>,
where you need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various fields/methods
of the <A
HREF="database/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/database/server/DatabaseService.java">DatabaseService.java</A>
file to add support for returning and caching <A
HREF="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html">Map</A>
objects.

<li style="margin-bottom:1em"> You also need to complete the "TODO"
tasks in factory methods in the <A
HREF="client/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/common/ClientBeans.java">ClientBeans.java</A>
file that can be injected into Java classes using the Spring Autowired
annotation. </LI>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em">Finally, you need to implement the
"TODO" tasks in the <A
HREF="common/src/main/java/edu/vandy/recommender/common/model/Movie.java">Movie.java</A>
file.  </UL>

<p> As usual, your solution should strive to use no loops and few
if/else statements in this assignment and instead use Java functional
programming features (including lambda expressions, method references,
and Java Stream aggregate operations), as well as Project Reactor
reactive programming operators. Your solution will be considered
correct if it passes all the unit tests, is commented thoroughly, and
addresses my review comments. Solutions that are not commented
thoroughly will not be reviewed.</p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

<p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS395/tree/master/assignment3/">here</a>
in my GitHub repository.  Please pull this skeleton code into your
GitLab repository, read it carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers.

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Integration and Unit Tests</h4>

<p> There are unit tests that exercise all the "TODO" tasks you must
complete.  To compile and run these tests you need to use the provided
IntelliJ project.  You can run all the unit tests by opening the
Gradle tab, followed by navigating down to the "Tasks > verification >
check" submenu. All you need to do is double click on the "check"
submenu and all the tests will build and run automatically. </P>

<p> These tests increase our collective confidence that your solution
is working as expected.  As usual, testing only demonstrates the
presence of bugs, not their absence, so don't rely solely on the tests
to detect problems in your code. In particular, I will also provide
videos that walk through "frequently made mistakes" that you should
address.  Please address these issues prior to your submission(s) to
streamline our <A
HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/cs395/assignments.html">programming
assignment review and assessment</A> process.  </p>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

<p> Assignment 3 is designed to further deepen your understanding of
developing asynchronous microservices using Spring WebFlux and Project
Reactor parallel reactive programming features.  The skeletons and
tests are extensive, though you don't need to understand them all to
complete your solution.  This assignment may be more complicated than
earlier assignments, so please start early and ask questions in class,
office hours, and on the discussion forums to ensure you complete this
assignment successfully!  </p>
