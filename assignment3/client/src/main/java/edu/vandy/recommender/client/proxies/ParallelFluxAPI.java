/**
 * This interface provides the contract for the RESTful {@code
 * ParallelFluxController} API used in conjunction with the {@code
 * GatewayApplication}.  It defines the HTTP GET and POST methods that
 * can be used to interact with the {@code ParallelFluxController}
 * API, along with the expected request and response parameters for
 * each method.  However, since clients access the {@code
 * ParallelFluxController} API via the {@code GatewayApplication} it's
 * necessary to add a {@code @HttpExchange} prefix to this class.
 *
 * This interface uses Spring HTTP interface annotations that provide
 * metadata about the API, such as the type of HTTP request (i.e.,
 * {@code GET} or {@code POST}), the parameter types (which are
 * annotated with {@code GetExchange}, {@code PostExchange},
 * {@code @RequestPath}, {@code RequestBody}, or {@code RequestParam}
 * tags), and the expected response format.  HTTP interface uses these
 * annotations and method signatures to generate an implementation of
 * the interface that the client uses to make HTTP requests to the
 * API.
